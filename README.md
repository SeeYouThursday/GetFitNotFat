# GetFitNotFat

## Description

Pick a recipe then give calories, then user inputs the activity they want to do to burn off those calories. The app then returns the duration of that activity needed to burn off the calories from the food selected in addition to the calories burned for that activity. We learned how to avoid conflicts with merges while working with other collaborators in an agile work enviroment. Also, some APIs do not update their documents, and trial and error takes over.

## Usage

Visit this URL to access this application: <https://seeyouthursday.github.io/GitFitNotFat/>

Click on the Start Gitting Fit button to take you to the next page. Pick a food you would like to search up to get the recipe (i.e. donuts). From the list of recipes, pick the one you would like and click on the "+" button. That will take you to the confirmation page with the nutritional information. Once you're happy with your selection, click the "confirm" button to be taken to the workout portion. Then, search up the workout that you would like to perform to burn the calories (i.e. swimming) you would gain from eating the given recipe. The page will display the number of minutes you need to perform the chosen activity and the calories that you will burn. Finally, you click on the "final results" button. You will be taken to the final results page that will display the recipe information and the workout information together in a single page. The recipe card provides a link to the recipe instructions on a third-party site that will open in a new tab. You can go back to the beginning by clicking the "reset" button at the end to start the process over.
