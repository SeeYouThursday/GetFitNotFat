# GetFitNotFat

## Description

Pick a recipe then give calories, then user inputs their weight and activity they want to do to burn off those calories. The app then returns the duration of that activity needed to burn off the calories from the food selected.

## Usage

Click on the Start Gitting Fit button to take you to the next page. Pick a food you would like to search up to get the recipe. From the list of recipes, pick the one you would like and click on the "+" button. That will take you to the confirmation page with the nutritional information and once you're happy with your selection click the "confirm" button to be taken to the next page. On the next page, search up the workout that you would like to perform to burn the calories you would gain from eating the given recipe. The page will display the number of minutes you need to perform the chosen activity and the calories that it will burn. Once you click on the "final results" button you will be taken to the final results page that will display the recipe information and the workout information together in a single page. You can go back to the beginning by clicking the "reset" button at the end to start the process over.
